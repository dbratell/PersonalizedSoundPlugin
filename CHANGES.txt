Version 0.5.1.0    2003-06-02
-----------------------------------
*FEATURE* Paths to files under the Miranda directory are stored relative. That
          should make it possible to move Miranda (including the sound files)
          without breaking the plugin.

*BUGFIX*  The fallback sound was always the message sound, even when the event
          was an URL or file.

*BUGFIX*  Paths to files with space in them was quoted too many times. 


Version 0.5.0.0    2003-06-02
-----------------------------------
First release. Functional but without rigorous testing.
